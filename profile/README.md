Welcome to ESL Mining Robotics! We are a team of university researchers (Master's and PhD students) contributing towards the research and development of robotic technology for mining applications in collaberation with ENAEX Africa. This project is covered by a Nondisclosure Agreement (**NDA**) signed by all involved parties.
